# Payroll Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

1- This repository aims to clean and prepare a payroll dataset located in a   **database.sqlite** file
using the Pandas library in Python. 
The process includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and converting data types.
___
## Project Contents
- thThe original database file or initial dataset that was worked on `database.sqlite`
- Data cleaning code file `pands(2)`
-  The file resulting from the cleaning code, the data after cleaning `python Salaries cleaned` Two files, one in `CSV` format and the other in `XLSX` format

## Requirements/Dependencies

This project is designed to run smoothly on the Google Colaboratory (Colab) platform, where most of the prerequisites (Python 3.x, Pandas, NumPy) are preinstalled.
**you need**
- *colab*

To successfully run the `pands(2).ipynb` notebook, the following library must be installed within the Colab environment:

```bash
#Read a CSV file (or database) to clean it up
